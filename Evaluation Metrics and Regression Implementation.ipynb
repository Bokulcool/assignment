It measures how well the regression model fits the observed data, with values ranging from 0 to 1. An R-squared of 1 indicates that the model perfectly explains all the variability of the response data around its mean, while an R-squared of 0 means the model does not explain any of the variability.\n",

It ranges from 0 to 1 and always increases or stays the same when more predictors are added, regardless of their usefulness.

        "Mean Squared Error (MSE) is sensitive to outliers because the errors (differences between predicted and actual values) are squared before being averaged. Squaring the errors magnifies the impact of larger deviations disproportionately compared to smaller ones. This means that even a single large outlier can cause a significant increase in the MSE value, making the metric heavily influenced by extreme errors. This sensitivity often results in MSE reflecting poorer model performance when outliers are present, because the large squared errors dominate the average calculation.\n",

When this assumption holds, the model's errors are evenly distributed over the range of predicted values.\n",

        "Interaction terms enhance a regression model's predictive power by allowing the effect of one independent variable on the dependent variable to depend on the value of another independent variable. In other words, interaction terms capture joint or combined effects of variables that are not explained by their individual contributions alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "By including interaction terms—typically created as the product of two or more predictors—the model becomes more flexible and can represent situations where the relationship between a predictor and the outcome changes based on the level of another predictor. This allows the model to better fit complex patterns in data, improving accuracy and explanatory power.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in real estate price modeling, the effect of apartment size on price might differ depending on whether it is located in the city center or not.
