        "Heteroscedasticity can be identified in residual plots by observing a pattern where the spread (variance) of the residuals increases or decreases systematically with the fitted values. This typically appears as a fan or cone shape in the plot of residuals versus predicted values, indicating that the variance of the errors is not constant (non-constant variance). In a well-behaved model with homoscedasticity, residuals should be randomly scattered with roughly equal variance across all levels of the predicted values.\n",

        "\n",
        "Visual Inspection: Plot the fitted polynomial curve against the data points to visually assess if the curve captures the pattern without excessive wiggle. Residual plots can also reveal systematic deviations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-Validation: Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to estimate out-of-sample prediction error for polynomial models of varying degrees. The degree with the lowest prediction error balances bias and variance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Adjusted R²: Compared to regular R², adjusted R² penalizes extra predictors. The degree with the highest adjusted R² is preferred, indicating a parsimonious model that fits well without unnecessary complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Information Criteria: Measures like Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) balance fit and complexity, with lower values indicating better models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Analysis of Variance (ANOVA): Test for significance of polynomial terms when increasing degree. Only add terms if they provide statistically significant improvement to model fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "Regularization Techniques: Applying Lasso or Ridge regression during fitting to control coefficient magnitudes and prevent overfitting, indirectly guiding degree selection.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods help ensure the chosen polynomial degree provides a good fit with generalization capabilities rather than merely overfitting noise in the data.​"
