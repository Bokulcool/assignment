        "DDL (Data Definition Language)\n",
        "\n",
        "DDL commands are used to define, modify, and manage the structure of database objects such as tables, views, schemas, and indexes. These commands directly impact the schema or design rather than the individual records, and changes are often auto-committed.​\n",

        "DML commands manipulate the actual data stored within tables. These commands allow users to insert, update, delete, or modify records, but do not change the structure of the tables themselves. Changes made by DML commands can be rolled back if not committed.​\n",

        "Example:\n",

        "DQL (Data Query Language)\n",
        "\n",
        "DQL commands are focused solely on querying and retrieving data from tables. The primary DQL command is SELECT, which enables users to view data based on specified criteria, without modifying the data or structure itself.​\n",
